# DraftJS powered WebGL Text Editor / Renderer

## [Live Demo](https://dakom.github.io/webgl-text-editor)

## Status

Pretty much working now, albeit at a very basic level :)

## TODO

* Size the canvas element based on the final actual dimensions
* Add font-family dropdown option to menu
* Add font-size dropdown option to menu
* Add color picker to menu

## NOTES

Canvas text can do a whole bunch of fancy things that the text editor can't show. In this demo, there could be menu options for those since there's a left/right split... but on a real app, not sure how that would be displayed. Same goes for WebGL effects.
